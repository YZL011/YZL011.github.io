Welcome to my homepage! My name is Yuzhe Lei (雷雨哲). I am a research and theory track master's student in the School of Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. I received my bachelor's degree in Labor and Social Security at Renmin University of China, with a minor in Journalism, and my first master's degree in Advertising at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

I'm interested in studying political communication and emerging technologies in the global context. My current work-in-progress projects focus on topics such as media trust, Internet censorship, political expression, political influencers, and political fandom. My recent paper, The Media Trust Gap and its Political Explanations: How Individual and Socio-environmental Factors Differentiate News Trust Preferences in Asian Societies, won the third-place top paper award from the Political Communication Division at AEJMC.

Methodologically, my past and ongoing projects involve various research methods, including surveys, experiments, content analysis, secondary data analysis, computational methods, in-depth interviews, etc. In my future career, I tend to use computational, qualitative, or experimental methods in my research, depending on which is suitable to address my research questions.
