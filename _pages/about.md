Welcome to my homepage! 

My name is Yuzhe (Julian) Lei. I am a research and theory track master’s student in the School of Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. Before coming to America, I studied in Beijing and Hong Kong. 

My research interests are mainly focused on political communication and emerging technologies in the global context. The topics of my ongoing projects include media trust, Internet censorship, political expression, political influencers, and political fandom. My recent paper, The Media Trust Gap and Its Political Explanations: How Individual and Socio-Environmental Factors Differentiate News Trust Preferences in Asian Societies, won the third-place top paper award from the Political Communication Division at AEJMC.

Methodologically, my past and ongoing projects involve various research methods, including surveys, experiments, content analysis, secondary data analysis, computational methods, in-depth interviews, etc. In my future career, I will primarily apply computational, qualitative, and experimental methods in my research, depending on which one suits my research questions.
